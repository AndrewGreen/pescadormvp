		Pescador MVP is a modular <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP</a>
		framework for <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/">GWT</a>
		that builds on <a
			href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideMvpActivitiesAndPlaces">standard
			MVP-related classes provided by GWT</a>. Its main features include the
		association of places, activities, views and components using <a
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">generics</a>,
		and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/">GIN-based
			dependency injection</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Components</h3>

	<p>At its core, Pescador MVP is a set of conventions for organizing
		your code, and some classes that help you work with those conventions.</p>

	<p>A central concept of Pescador MVP is the component. A component
		is a collection of related classes, plus a class that implements
		{@link mx.org.pescadormvp.client.components.Component} and provides an
		interface for any external services that the component may offer to
		other components. Classes that implement {@link
		mx.org.pescadormvp.client.components.Component} also perform tasks of
		general interest to the component and set GIN bindings for all the
		classes in the component.</p>

	<p>Normally, all the classes in a component reside in the same
		package, or at least share an ancestor package in the package
		hierarchy.</p>

	<p>
		To use the MVP architecture with Pescador MVP, you designate certain
		components as "Place-Activity-View components". These special
		components associate a place class, an activity class, a view class,
		and a region of the UI, and provide an implementation of {@link
		mx.org.pescadormvp.client.placesandactivities.PescadorMVPPAVComponent}.
		Pescador MVP and GWT take care of activating activities and views in
		the right place at the right time. If you need to share implementations
		and specifications across places, activities, views and UI regions,
		you can use standard Java inheritance and polymorphism. (See <a
			href="#pavcompoennts">below</a> for more details.)
	</p>

	<p>
		In its present form, Pescador MVP does <b>not</b>:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>enforce any conventions;</li>
		<li>enforce encapsulation;</li>
		<li>provide a way to specify dependencies among components;</li>
		<li>provide a way to group components into larger units;</li>
		<li>have fancy code generation to save you from reams of boilerplate; or</li>
		<li>allow hot-swapping of components at runtime.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is conceivable that some of these features (excluding the
		last one) might be implemented some time in the future. But even
		without them, Pescador MVP can help keep your client codebase nice and clean.
		(At least, that has been the author's experience.)</p>
